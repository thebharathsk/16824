    Match centers of the locations of FPN feature with a set of GT bounding
    boxes of the input image. Since our model makes predictions at every FPN
    feature map location, we must supervise it with an appropriate GT box.
    There are multiple GT boxes in image, so FCOS has a set of heuristics to
    assign centers with GT, which we implement here.

    NOTE: This function is NOT BATCHED. Call separately for GT box batches.

            dimension. Dictionary of three keys: (p3, p4, p5) giving tensors of
            shape `(H * W, 2)` where H = W is the size of feature map.
        strides_per_fpn_level: Dictionary of same keys as above, each with an
            integer value giving the stride of corresponding FPN level.
            See `common.py` for more details.

            codebase, this tensor is directly served by the dataloader.

    Compute distances from feature locations to GT box edges. These distances
    are called "deltas" - `(left, top, right, bottom)` or simply `LTRB`. The
    feature locations and GT boxes are given in absolute image co-ordinates.

    These deltas are used as targets for training FCOS to perform box regression
    and centerness regression. They must be "normalized" by the stride of FPN
    feature map (from which feature locations were computed, see the function
    `get_fpn_location_coords`). If GT boxes are "background", then deltas must
    be `(-1, -1, -1, -1)`.

    NOTE: This transformation function should not require GT class label. Your
    implementation must work for GT boxes being `(N, 4)` or `(N, 5)` tensors -
    without or with class labels respectively. You may assume that all the

    method is used for inference in FCOS: deltas are outputs from model, and

    Recall in above method, we were required to normalize the deltas by feature
    stride. Similarly, we have to un-normalize the input deltas with feature
    stride before applying them to locations, because the given input locations are
    already absolute co-ordinates in image dimensions.
